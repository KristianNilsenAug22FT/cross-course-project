# My Rainy Days Project

My HTML and CSS CA project

## Description

The design has evolved as I learned HTML and CSS.
I changed the top menu to scale to smaller screens insted of hding it like in the design.
Added a footer aswell because it looks and feels better.
I also changed the cart and buyout page because I think it didn't look right on the design.
